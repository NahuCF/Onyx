# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

## Project overview

Onyx is a C++/OpenGL game engine with an integrated 3D editor (`MMOEditor3D`). On top of the engine the repository hosts a fully functional multiplayer RPG (MMOGame) — login server, world server, game client, and world editor.

Detailed documentation is split under [docs/](docs/) — see the index below.

## Engineering philosophy

**Build the best long-term solution, not the cheapest short-term one.** When proposing approaches, optimize for the engine and game we want to ship — not for what's fastest to wire up today. Do not recommend "good enough" shortcuts (ImGui for shipping HUDs, pre-rendered glyph PNGs, hand-rolled one-offs) when the project will need a proper system anyway. Surface the real long-term path first; if a shortcut is genuinely warranted (throwaway prototype, unblocking a dependency), call it out explicitly as a stop-gap with the proper plan named.

This applies to architecture decisions, library choices, and tooling: prefer the right foundation over a quick patch, even when the patch would land sooner.

## Quick build

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

Binaries land in `./build/bin/` (`MMOEditor3D`, `MMOClient`, `MMOLoginServer`, `MMOWorldServer`, `OnyxEditor`). There is **no** `build.sh` — use CMake directly. CMake presets (`linux-debug`, `linux-release`, `windows-debug`, etc.) are also available — see [docs/build.md](docs/build.md).

**Always rsync to Windows after building** (WSL2 → Windows desktop):
```bash
rsync -av --delete --exclude='build/' --exclude='.git/' /home/god/git/Onyx/ /mnt/c/Users/god/Desktop/Onyx/
```

## Quick run (MMO)

1. PostgreSQL with schema applied:
   ```bash
   PGPASSWORD=root psql -h localhost -U root -d mmogame -f MMOGame/Database/schema.sql
   ```
2. `./build/bin/MMOLoginServer` (port 7000)
3. `./build/bin/MMOWorldServer` (port 7001)
4. `./build/bin/MMOClient`

See [docs/mmogame-overview.md](docs/mmogame-overview.md) for full project structure, controls, classes, creatures, and the network protocol.

## Coding conventions

- Member vars `m_PascalCase`, methods `PascalCase`, locals `camelCase`, constants/enums `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Engine namespace `Onyx`; Editor3D top-level namespace `MMO` and `Editor3D` for terrain.
- `IndexBuffer` constructor takes byte count, not element count: `new IndexBuffer(data, count * sizeof(uint32_t))`.
- `Texture::Bind(slot)` + `Shader::SetInt("u_…", slot)` (no `SetBool`).
- `const` wherever possible; references over pointers when null isn't valid; smart pointers for ownership.

Full conventions in [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md).

## Commit conventions

- Conventional Commits style: lowercase prefix with optional scope — `feat:`, `fix(scope):`, `chore(tooling):`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `perf:`.
- **Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` (or any other Claude/AI attribution) to commit messages, PR descriptions, or code comments.** Author the work as the human committer.
- Subject ≤ ~70 chars. Use the body to explain *why*.

### Reference / design docs
- [docs/SceneRenderer_AssetManager_Spec.md](docs/SceneRenderer_AssetManager_Spec.md) — **Historical implementation plan (2026-02-17).** Has known drifts; prefer `engine-rendering.md` for current API. Useful for design rationale.
- [docs/rendering-pipeline.md](docs/rendering-pipeline.md) — Tutorial on Editor3D viewport rendering, MSAA, SSAO chain (2026-02-22).
- [docs/frustum-culling-math.md](docs/frustum-culling-math.md) — Math derivation for plane/AABB tests (timeless).
- [docs/race-class-system-design.md](docs/race-class-system-design.md) — Race/class design intent (2026-02-19); may not reflect current implementation.

## Memory references

External notes kept under Claude's memory (not in repo):

- **AzerothCore reference** (terrain, pathfinding, ADT/WMO/M2 formats, grid loading, liquid types): `~/.claude/projects/-home-god-git-Onyx/memory/azerothcore-reference.md`
- **Editor3D phase-by-phase development checklist** (Phases 1–10: foundation, viewport, gizmos, panels, terrain, object placement, selection, templates, export, polish): `~/.claude/projects/-home-god-git-Onyx/memory/editor3d-checklist.md`

The MMO and engine follow several AzerothCore/TrinityCore patterns: grid-based visibility, visitor pattern (`ForEachPlayerNear`), spell effects composed from `SpellEffect` structs, auras with periodic ticks, dirty-flag system for delta updates, and cell activation by player proximity.

## Legacy 2D editor

`MMOGame/Editor/` is the legacy isometric 2D tile editor (predecessor to `MMOEditor3D`). Kept for reference; not actively developed. Its `Source/` includes the chunk-based tile map, tileset/painting tools, and panel architecture documented inside that folder.
